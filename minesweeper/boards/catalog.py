"""The menu catalog, derived from two small registries.

Everything the menu and CLI need -- MODE_LABELS, TILINGS, SURFACE_LABELS,
the geometry-first menu tables, MODES_3D -- is *derived* here from
SURFACE_SPECS and TILING_SPECS rather than hand-listed. Adding a periodic
tiling means adding one
ArchTiling row (in tilings.py) and one ARCH_PRESETS row (in presets.py);
adding a surface means adding one SurfaceSpec here plus a builder. See
AGENTS.md. A mode string is always ``surface.prefix + tiling.key`` unless
the tiling overrides it (a few legacy names do).

# glide), so the orientation-reversing Mobius seam cannot glue them to
# themselves (needs_mirror gates them out). The sphere is its own group:
# none of these planar patterns can tile it (Euler's formula forces
# curvature in), so it offers spherical tilings instead. To add a surface
# (e.g. the Klein bottle) add a SurfaceSpec here and wire its builders.

#   Classic         -> flat squares, at once

#   Sphere          -> the spherical tilings
#   Other           -> the solids, and the shaped boards
#

# and (flat-only) aperiodic families as submenus, then a random option; it is
# parameterised by the surface it was reached through, so the same picker serves
# the plane and every flat manifold. Chiral tilings are gated out of the Mobius
