# -- The Hat: an aperiodic monotile ------------------------------------------
#
# "The Hat" (Smith-Myers-Kaplan-Goodman-Strauss, 2023) is a single
# 13-sided tile that tiles the plane only aperiodically. Every hat
# vertex lies on the Eisenstein integer lattice -- point (a, b) is
# a*(1,0) + b*(1/2, sqrt3/2) = _hexpt(a, b) -- so a vertex id is an
# exact integer pair and shared-vertex adjacency needs no tolerance,
# just like penrose_board above.
#
# The tiling is grown by the H/T/P/F metatile substitution. The
# substitution transforms are ported from Craig S. Kaplan's "hatviz"
# reference (github.com/isohedral/hatviz, BSD 3-Clause, (c) 2023 Craig
# S. Kaplan). Those transforms carry irrational (sqrt3) translations, so
# they run in floating point; each final vertex is then snapped back to
# its exact Eisenstein integer id. The lattice spacing is 1 and the
# accumulated error over a handful of inflations is ~1e-13, so the snap
# is exact and two hats meeting at a point snap to the same id -- float
# is transient, ids are exact, seams are impossible.

# -- The Spectre: a chiral aperiodic monotile --------------------------------
#
# Tile(1,1) (Smith-Myers-Kaplan-Goodman-Strauss, 2023) is the equilateral
# member of the hat continuum: a 13-gon that is also an equilateral 14-gon,
# two of whose edges are collinear. Forbid reflections and it tiles the
# plane only aperiodically -- a *weakly chiral* aperiodic monotile -- and
# this board is that reflection-free tiling, grown by the paper's own
# substitution over nine collared cluster types (Gamma, the Mystic, plus
# the eight collared Spectres Delta Theta Lambda Xi Pi Sigma Phi Psi). A
# Spectre cluster expands to seven Spectres and a Mystic, a Mystic cluster
# to six and a Mystic; the Mystic is a *cluster*, so it contributes two
# cells to the board, not one.
#
# It is a genuinely different tiling from the Hat board next to it, not a
# re-skin: the deformation that carries our hat patch to Tile(1,1) keeps
# the hat's ~1-in-7 mirrored tiles and its cell graph, whereas here no
# tile is ever mirrored.
#
# The substitution transforms are ported from Craig S. Kaplan's "spectre"
# reference (cs.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/spectre/spectre.js, (c) 2023 Craig S.
# Kaplan) -- the same provenance as the hat's rules above. Unlike the hat
# port, no floating point is involved at any stage: every edge direction is
# a multiple of 30 degrees and every placement is z -> zeta^k*z + t with
# zeta = exp(i*pi/6), so all of it runs in the ring Z[zeta12] (below) with
# integer arithmetic. That matters here in a way it did not for the hat:
# Z[zeta12] is *dense* in the plane rather than discrete, so there is no
# lattice to snap a float vertex back to. Carrying the placements exactly
# is the only way to get exact vertex ids.

# A point of Z[zeta12] as 4 integer coefficients over the basis
