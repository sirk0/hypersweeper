"""Load the shared JSON config both front-ends read (``data/*.json``).

The pygame and TypeScript apps read the same geometry configuration so it is
never written twice. These files are the single source of truth; ``catalog.py``
and ``presets.py`` load them here. See ``scripts/export_data.py`` and
``docs/agents/shared-data.md``.

The data directory sits at the repo root next to ``minesweeper/``. That holds in
both the dev checkout and the pygbag web stage (``make web-prepare`` copies
``data/`` alongside the package), so ``parents[2]`` resolves it in each.
