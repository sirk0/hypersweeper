"""Render mid-game board screenshots of the pygame build for the README.

Drives the real GUI screens headlessly: seed the rng, reveal a patch of
cells, flag a few real mines, optionally detonate one, then save the
supersampled canvas downscaled to the size a player actually sees.

The README's own gallery comes from the TypeScript app
(`web/scripts/make-screenshots.mts`, written into docs/screenshots); the
pygame build is the reference implementation and gets the one shot in its
own section, so these land in docs/screenshots/pygame. Add a row to SHOTS
to render any other board — nothing here is limited to the README set.

Usage: PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/make_screenshots.py [output_dir]
       (default output dir: docs/screenshots/pygame)
